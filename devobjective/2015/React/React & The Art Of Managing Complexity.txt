#React & The Art Of Managing Complexity

* About me.
* What is React?
* What Is Complexity?
	* The Wrong Abstraction
		* MVC is the wrong abstraction!
		* Composibility is the right pattern
			* Separation of concerns doesn't mean model, view, and controller
				* It means separation of disparate components
				* Show composing a complex UI with React
			* Pause for dramatic effect....
				* Markup and actions are inherently tightly coupled
				* JSX!
					* Its NOT MARKUP
					* it's not the onClick handler from the early 90's!
		* Mutability
			* Once you start changing things you start introducing unpredictability.
			* Immutability!
				* Props in a React application are immutable
				* Immutability is boring.
				* State is how data changes in react.  
					* When state changes, just re-render EVERYTHING.
						* The key is that you re-render the  Virtual DOM (fast, nothing is composted or painted)
						* Diff actual DOM with real DOM.
							* Who remembers their CS?  Big oh?  What is tree traversal?  
							* O(n^3)! 
								* Show directed graph with comparison.
							* React's diff algorithm creates a patch, and applies it to the real DOM.

* But what about my data
	* Flux!
		* A bit about the flux architecture
		* Still one way data flow
