#React & The Art Of Managing Complexity

* About me.
* What is React?
* What Is Complexity?
	* The inability to reason about what is mutating state in your app
	* Complex code paths
	* The Wrong Abstractions
		* MVC is the wrong abstraction!
		* Composibility is the right pattern
			* Separation of concerns doesn't mean model, view, and controller
				* It means separation of disparate components
				* Show composing a complex UI with React
			* Pause for dramatic effect....
				* Markup and actions are inherently tightly coupled
				* JSX!
					* Its NOT MARKUP
					* it's not the onClick handler from the early 90's!
* How does React help these things?
	* Simply put, it encourages one-way data binding and immutability
	* One way data binding
	* Immutability!
	* Limit state Changes
		* However when 
			* It's not slow.
				* Tree traversal is O(n^3)
				* But not with immutable data!
* But what about my data
	* Flux!
		* A bit about the flux architecture
		* Still one way data flow
